# GHANA COMMERCIAL BANK DEPOSIT RECEIPT CLONE - JAVA
	
	In this short program, I use JAVA to create a simple console 
	application to mimic the deposit procedure and receipt handling
	at the Ghana Commercial Bank. 

	Upon deposit, the program prints out the following details for the
	user
		- Time and Date
		- Amount 
		- Account Number
		- Transaction ID
		- Account Name
		- etc

	This is a simple program to help me test out the JAVA programming
	language.
